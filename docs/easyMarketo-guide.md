## 🔍 Why We Created This Extension
In working with landing pages, three main tasks often proved cumbersome and time-consuming:

### 📝 Project Name Identification
Identifying the project name is helpful for coordinating between Marketo and Wrike. It allows us to easily find the corresponding project in Wrike since we use the same naming convention across both platforms, making project tracking more straightforward.

### 🔗 Navigating to the Marketo Program
If you wanted to navigate to the Marketo program associated with a landing page, you had to:

* 🗂️ Find the project name that the page belongs to.
* 🛠️ Access the Marketo path task for that project in Wrike and retrieve the link.

While there were other ways to access the program, all of them involved time-consuming steps. The **EasyMarketo** simplifies this process. With just one click on the **"MKTO Path"** button, you’re immediately taken to the Marketo program where the LP is built.

### 📈 Checking Registration Details for a Form on the LP
Checking the total registration from a form on an LP usually involved:
* 📂 Going to the Marketo program associated with the page.
* 📝 Sometimes, raising a Wrike request to get the registration list, or manually searching Salesforce for the campaign name linked to the page.

Since Salesforce campaigns are often integrated with Marketo forms, this step was crucial, but it was also time-consuming to navigate to respective SFDC. The extension resolves this by providing a direct link. Clicking the **"SFDC Campaign Path"** button instantly takes you to the Salesforce campaign associated with the page, where you can view registration data and other important details.

## 💡 How It Works

* 🖱️ Click on the extension icon, and it will automatically show you the Program name and buttons for navigating to the Marketo Program and Salesforce Campaign.



## 🛠️ Note to Automation Team:

This tool uses data from the landing page (LP) to identify relevant links.
### ⚠️ Important:
- Ensure the SFDC Campaign ID (ex: 7014z000001cXvyAAE) is added to the LP during the build process, specifically in the UTM | Campaign value field within the Marketo editor.
- Also, assign the appropriate form(s) to the landing page, even if the form(s) is not being used.
