## ✨ Overview
The **EasyMarketo** is a Chrome extension designed to streamline the process of accessing Marketo programs and associated Salesforce campaigns directly from landing pages. By automating navigation to essential links, this extension saves time and enhances productivity for users working with Marketo and Salesforce.

## 🪄 Features
* **📝 Project Name Identification:**  Quickly identifies the project associated with the landing page.
* **🚀 Direct Navigation**: One-click access to the Marketo program linked to the landing page.
* **📊 Salesforce Campaign Access**: Instantly navigate to the Salesforce campaign associated with the landing page.


## 🔍 Why We Created This Extension
Working with landing pages often involves three key tasks that can be time-consuming:

### 📝 Project Name Identification
Identifying the project name is essential for aligning between Marketo and Wrike. Since we use the same naming convention across both platforms, this feature helps streamline project tracking.

### 🔗 Navigating to the Marketo Program
Navigating to a Marketo program required multiple steps, such as:

* 🛠️ Accessing the Marketo path task for that project in Wrike to retrieve the link.

With **EasyMarketo**, just click the "MKTO Path" button to directly open the Marketo program where the landing page  is built.

### 📈 Checking Registration Details for a Form on the LP
To check form registrations, you typically had to:
* 📂 Access the associated Marketo program.
* 📝 Possibly submit a Wrike request or manually search Salesforce for the campaign name.

Since Salesforce campaigns are often integrated with Marketo forms, this step was crucial, but it was also time-consuming to navigate to respective SFDC. The extension resolves this by providing a direct link. Clicking the **"SFDC Campaign Path"** button instantly takes you to the Salesforce campaign associated with the page, where you can view registration data and other important details.

## 🚀 How to Install the Extension
👉 Click this [**link**](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/aooojlnnppjpchpfjofohbgacpkelfpf) to access the extension page, then simply click on **“Add to Chrome”**. Once added, 📌pin **EasyMarketo** to your extensions tab, and you're all set🎉.

## 💡 How It Works
* 🌐 Open any landing page (LP) created in Marketo.
* 🖱️ Click on the extension icon, and it will automatically show you the Program name and buttons for navigating to the Marketo Program and Salesforce Campaign.



## 🛠️ Note to Automation Team:

This tool uses data from the landing page (LP) to identify relevant links.
### ⚠️ Important:
- Ensure the SFDC Campaign ID (ex: 7014z000001cXvyAAE) is added to the LP during the build process, specifically in the UTM | Campaign value field within the Marketo editor.
- Also, assign the appropriate form(s) to the landing page, even if the form(s) is not being used.
